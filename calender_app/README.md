# calender_app

An interactive calendar app which inclues both todo lists for days, and notifications for events that are happening
This project will help me better manage my school/work life balance, plan ahead for events, balance my workload each day. The goal is to publish this as a website to make it accessable for all devices.
For the future, I'm hoping to make this project accessable in the app store for ease of use.
